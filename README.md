I'm back to write this from Module 5.
I copied this project and renamed a copy to work on JPA/Servlets/JSP. When I tried to push my new project to the Module 5 repo, it was committed to this repo and I have no idea how to remove the extra files created for the Module 5 assignment. 
Everything is still the same, just have some extra files from module 5. StartProgram.java still working the same as it was before.
